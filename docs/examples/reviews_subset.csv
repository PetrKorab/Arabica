2010-08-19,"You may find yourself trying to decide between comparable crystallized ginger offerings from Reeds and The Ginger People. Which one should you choose? I have now tried both, and here is how they compare.<br /><br />Reed's has a lovely raw cane sugar flavor, and is sweeter and more mellow than The Ginger People's.<br /><br />If you want something a little less sweet (still sweet though--it is crystallized ginger, after all) and a little spicier, go for The Ginger People."
2009-06-05,"On the Reeds website, this same product is available for $16.00.<br /><br />""Reed's Crystallized Ginger Candy 12 - 3.5 oz Bags"""
2009-07-26,"Ginger candy is one of my favorite things to eat (besides chocolate and cinammon!) If you drink Ginger Beer (a strong Jamaican-style Ginger ale) then you know that Reed's is one of the best ones around. That being said, their crystallized candy is tasty, but absolutely looks terrible. The hot, spicy, sugary pieces are extremely small, jagged and look like rubber plugs. Some even look unappetizing  -- although the taste is fantastic. And I know, if you're a ginger candy fanatic -- like myself -- the price is right. (Most know that ginger candy is expensive, so this buy 12 bags in bulk is a steal).<br /><br />I know that you aren't supposed to judge a book by its cover, and if ginger candy is your thing, you won't be disappointed with Reed's Candy in spite of its looks. And yes, I would definitely buy this package again simply for taste alone.<br /><br />One side note I thought I'd throw in: Ginger's great for medicinal purposes for calming your tummy -- if you've got constant stomach upsets, nausea, etc;."
2009-03-14,"A friend got me started on candied ginger for headache and nausea relief. I would buy the ginger from a local health food store but when I saw this brand on Amazon, it was less expensive so I decided to try it. Whereas the health food store ginger was chewy like leather, this has more of a gum drop texture. I didn't think I would keep using it but pretty soon I was addicted and it became difficult to keep a steady supply on hand. Yum!"
2009-07-31,This stuff is just full of pure ginger flavor and the right amount of sweetness.  My son on the autism spectrum loves it to satisfy his oral sensory needs.  But he has to fight me for it! ;)
2011-10-31,"I love ginger candy but would NOT buy Reed's brand anymore. On September 2010, I ordered $42 worth of Reed's products from their online store. They charged my credit card and I generously allowed time for  shipping. Finally after two months, I emailed the Chief Operating Officer that I have not received my order. I was told they do not ship to APO (military address) and yet charged my credit card two months prior. I then asked for a refund as it was too late for charge reversal by the  credit card company. I never heard back (and never got the refund) even after a repeat email and phone message. So much for customer service."
2012-05-01,"I buy this same ginger in a bin from the health food store often. The store is on vacation so I decided to try these little bags. The first one I opened was dark, dry and NO favor what so ever. Then I tried another bag, it was the same! They are clearly very old. Be careful and know these are not returnable! I'm going to call customer service and see what I can do to be able to return them. They shouldn't be selling bad food. I love Amazon and always trust they will take returns. This time I found out they won't."
2010-08-05,"This is my favorite crystallized ginger.  It took me a while to figure out why, but I think it is because they use ""baby"" ginger root.  In any case it is soft and just spicy enough for my taste.  I love eating it with dark chocolate and a glass of cold milk.  Or nibble one after I've eaten junk food that has upset my tummy.  It is also very conisistent flavor from bag to bag compared to some brands."
2010-04-09,"Crystallized ginger is used by many people to control nausea, whether it is from motion sickness or other causes, including chemotherapy.  Some people prefer it to over-the-counter medications because it lacks the potential side effects of the medications.  It is usually hard to find in stores, and this product available from Amazon has a good price.  If you have children who are prone to getting car sick, I would recommend trying this."
2011-09-02,"I have to say that it was an easy call buying Reed's ginger, because I love their ginger ale. I'd say if you enjoy their ginger ale, you'll LOVE this, because I'm pretty sure it's the same ginger! The pieces are fairly uniform and a good size, cubed, and not overly sugared. The flavor is hot, not like overly mature ginger, but on the hot end. Don't get me wrong, it's a heat I love, but compared to my other favorite (The Ginger People) it's the spicy end of the spectrum.<br /><br />This ginger has a unique flavor and color; more of a deep orange color with a complex flavor that is... again... reminiscent of Reed's ginger ale and I love it! I'm not entirely sure what kind of ginger it is, because it's different from most that I've eaten, but not in anything like a bad way. Still, it should be noted that it DOES have that full and complex ginger flavor, and a strong one. If you want some sweet confection with light ginger flavor... this is not it. If you want a bold ginger that still has the smooth texture and taste of baby ginger, this is definitely it.<br /><br />That's the other wonderful thing about Reed's... this is clearly BABY ginger, and that means when you bite into a chunk you won't have fiber strands in your teeth. Too much crystallized ginger is made from fully mature ginger (which is great) and ends up prejudicing people... they believe crystallized ginger = blazing heat and a tough chew. This is hot, but not that, ""ow my mouth!"" experience of mature ginger. I give it four stars only because of my personal preference, and while I love this ginger, the unique taste of whatever type it is ranks second in my book. I want to be clear however, that it's purely a matter of preference, and I suspect many people will prefer this ginger.<br /><br />Finally, this ginger would make some amazing tea, and while baking with it would take some chopping, I would definitely make the effort. All I can say that I love this crystallized ginger, and anyone who enjoys it should give this a try. You may find that you have a new favorite type of ginger, and if not, you're still almost certainly going to enjoy it like crazy.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people eat ginger for health purposes, but I can't speak to that. I CAN attest that of all the gingers I've tried for motion sickness, this wins hands down. Maybe it's the variety of ginger, or the contrast between the strong ginger, but not painful or rough that does it... I don't know. I'm a skeptical person, so of course this is just anecdotal evidence, but I can only say that it's STRONG anecdotal evidence.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a tasty, hot and sweet, perfectly textured ginger that has a unique taste that is hard to put down."
2010-05-26,"I've always loved Ginger. I remember when I was a much younger (longer ago than I care to ponder) my mom always kept Ginger root in the house, and whenever she found some Ginger candy she would pick some up for me.  The taste for Ginger stuck.  I'm a fan of Reed's Ginger products - candy, crystallized - any form.<br /><br />Outstanding quality and taste, not too much sugar.  Crunchy.  Just what I want!"
2011-11-04,"I've tried various brands of ginger to add to my trail mix and this seems to be a bit more consistant than the Sun Valley, that tended to have a bit more fibers and varying stages of quality.  I've opened an used about 1/2 of the 12 pk but agree with another reviewer that there's too much sugar on these.  I'll buy this brand again, but will find ways to remove as much sugar as possible before adding to my trail mix."
2011-07-21,"I try to avoid sugar because of its inflammatory properties.  Ginger is highly anti-inflammatory, so I've been trying various ginger chews and candies, trying to find one that tastes good without so much sugar.  This one is spicy and has a good taste, but they could make it with less than half the sugar and have a much healthier snack."
2011-02-16,"I think of this product more as a first aid tool--motion sickness, digestive troubles. An alternative to over-the-counter medications.  The science behind it is strong. Do not listen to medical people who dismiss it as ""quackery"".<br /><br />I would keep it in my glove compartment and cupboard. Strong ginger taste (either you love or you don't) balanced by the cane sugar, which ensures rapid assimilation."
2012-02-23,"Reed's Ginger Candy is a good tasty healthy treat, and it was made well. The pieces could have been a little smaller size just for my preference, but it was  deliciously full-flavored and I will order it again. Ginger is great for what ails you."
2010-10-21,"i love this stuff!  it's sweet but not too sweet, chewy and very tangy (almost pepper hot).  not something you could eat a lot of, which is good.  one or two a day is a satisfying fix."
2010-10-18,"I became addicted to crystalized ginger from eating The Ginger People's Organic baby ginger. That one is my favorite. This one is a very close second. The difference between the two? This one is a mite tougher and out of 5 bags, I've found about 3 pieces that are just too fibrous to swallow. The ginger people's organic is as soft as gumdrops. The Reed's are spicier also so if you like them spicy, you would prefer these. I see nothing wrong with their look or color as one reviewer stated. They look like what they are. They're delicious!"
2010-08-31,I will not run out of crystallized ginger for some time. Shipment was prompt and product tasty.
2010-12-22,"i can get a 16 oz bag of this cheaper (about 10 cents cheaper per oz) but if you have amazong prime & you want to send this you save a ton of money (2 day shipping)<br />this product is superb, i use it in baking, add it to oatmeal with cranberries & just eat it alone.. though it can be a tiny bit spicey it is very calming to the stomach . & the small packages mean you dont have to use it to fast to keep it fresh.<br /><br />highly recommend trying this product!"
2012-09-27,Best tasting Crystalized ginger on the market which is all natural with no sulfides or artificial anything. Sweet & tangy. Great for indigestion or for overall great health---You will be amazed
2012-07-02,This is pure ginger coated with a light dusting of sugar to make it a little easier to eat.  It is very soothing for sour throats and colds.  I eat them even when i'm not sick cause they are delicious.
2011-02-15,I bought this for my wife who was in her the early parts of her first trimester with our third child.  She is very reluctant to take any medication for her nausea but this Ginger worked quickly and very well.  I also tried ginger capsules and they didn't help nearly as much.  I would highly recommend this to any woman who is dealing with nausea related to pregnancy.<br /><br />I have also used it myself when my stomach was feeling 'off' and it has also helped.
2011-01-06,"I ordered these to help with my morning sickness.  I feel car sick all day long generally.  Munching a bit on these really does help!  My husband also loves them!  The flavor it very good.  My son (who is 2) also enjoys them.  They have a good, strong ginger flavor, but it's not too much.  I'm glad we got so many little bags of them cause they will stay fresh longer.  The texture is good.  The pieces are firm to hold but soft to chew.  I'd recommend this product to someone dealing with morning sickness, or any ginger fan.  I'm both, and quite pleased!"
2011-03-01,I've tried different types of crystalized ginger and this one was a little disappointing. Very small bags for the value and lots of fiber in the bites.<br />I don't think I'll order this particular brand again.
2011-04-20,"I bought these for my wife for her morning sickness. Those ""Preggie Pops"" are expensive, and I thought since they are essentially ginger candies, and since it's the ginger that helps with the nausia that I could find a cheaper alternative.<br /><br />Well the verdict is that the crystalized ginger is too spicy. My wife doesn't like raw ginger anyway, but she drinks Gigner Ale soda, so I thought that this product would be similar to that, but it was too spicy for her, and now I'm stuck with a bunch of crystalized ginger that nobody is going to eat."
