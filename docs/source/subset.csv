I have now tried both, and here is how they compare.<br /><br />Reed's has a lovely raw cane sugar flavor, and is sweeter and more mellow than The Ginger People's.<br /><br />If you want something a little less sweet (still sweet though--it is crystallized ginger, after all) and a little spicier, go for The Ginger People."
